# PT.PM (PT Pattern Matching Engine)

**PT Pattern Matching Engine**, or **PT.PM,** is an engine for searching patterns in the source code.
PT.PM is based on Unified Abstract Syntax Tree ([UAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree#Unified_AST),
UST). At present time C\#, Java, PHP, PL/SQL, T-SQL, and JavaScript
are supported. Patterns can be described within the code or using a
domain-specific language (DSL).
